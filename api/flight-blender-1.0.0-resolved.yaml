        ---------------------- Condition definition language ---------------- •
        A list of relevant characteristics (CHARTYPE) has first to be
        established per state, and their finite list of acceptable values
        (CHARVAL)

        • Each chartype and charval fields are defined by a limited set of
        characters

        • A public document shall give the definitions of each, and provide the
        reference to legal or technical characteristics implied

        • The Geozone editor per state can use these characteristics, with the
        dedicated condition language defined below, to define exact conditions
        per zone

        • Each UAS Geofencing function shall be loaded with the corresponding
        chararacteristic status of the UAS for the intended flight, so as to be
        able to apply the conditions , either to generate alerts or to limit the
        flight

        • If the value of a given characteristic of the condition equation is
        not defined in the UAS, the UAS Geofencing function should inform the
        pilot in Geoawareness alerting or consider that the zone is forbidden,
        by default in automatic Geofencing.

        A conditional expression shall be of the following type:

        • The UAS is PERMITTED XOR PROHIBITED (exclusive choice) to fly in this
        zone at this time IF (Characteristic1) CHARTYPE1 = (Value1) CHARVAL1 AND

        CHARTYPE 2 = CHARVAL 2 AND ... AND End IF

        OR (...)

        ...

        End OR

        • Only the fields in bold need to be edited in the character string,
        separated by”/”. Others are implicit.

        Examples of CHARTYPE and CHARVALUE:

        • CHARTYPE: operator type; Acceptable CHARVAL values:
        Military/Police/Firefighting

        • CHARTYPE: Operator ID (registration number); Acceptable CHARVAL
        values: as per registration format

        • CHARTYPE: Operation type: A1 as per EASA Open Types or S1 (National
        standard Scenario 1), STS01 (EASA Specific standard scenario) or ...

        • CHARTYPE: UTM operation type: Planned/Unplanned,

        • CHARTYPE: passengers on board: yes /no Note that it is possible in
        each national catalog of chartype and charval items, to define complex
        categories of operation/drone /equipment. Example: In nation A, we may
        have a type “drone level” with values Low, Medium, High. Each level
        corresponds to a defined set of required UAS performance/operation
        features/ operator qualification etc. This avoids to code a complex
        combination in the geozone database. This conditional expression can
        also be used to code a prohibition of image capture in a zone.

        Example: PERMITTED/IMAGE CAPTURE=NO/NOISE

          CLASS=A/OR/OPERATOR=POLICE

        Meaning: >-
           the fight is permitted in this zone at that time if No image is
        captured (removed or deactivated) and if noise class = class A
        (following a known classification) or if the UAS operator is the Police
